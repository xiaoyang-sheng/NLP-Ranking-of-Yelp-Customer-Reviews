We were there on a Saturday night and for such a busy restaurant they really know about great service, not to mention the food was amazing, and the restaurant itself has a beautiful look. There were four of us dining, each had something different and all enjoyed our meal. Oysters, fish, clam chowder and lobster ravioli were delicious, and the staff were so helpful, sometimes at a busy restaurant you don't get much attention, but not here, we had a great experience and will return again.",5.0

It astonishes me time and time again how this deli carries things that usually require a trip to the grocery shop.  They have typical deli stuff and then all the random crap I need at the last minute like baking pans, batteries, greek yogurt, good cheese, Green & Black's chocolate, etc.  They make their own KimChi too.  I hope they start making more Korean food like bibimbap.  The staff are incredibly friendly.  Their flower selection is good too.  Oh- we got a lottery ticket here that won us $12 so it's lucky.",5.0

As I've said before Harold Seltzers is the finest dinning you will find in the Port Richey, Hudson area. They great you as an old Friend the first time you go there and every time after that. None of the staff seams to ever have a bad day. Everyone smiles and they are cheer full to the guest and one another. Harold's is a very well run ship.

Our food is always fresh, hot, and plentiful. There is always something to take home.

Do yourself and your Friends a big favor; Make Harold Seltzers a must. You won't be sorry.",5.0

They have strawberries, marshmallows, and wafers you can dip into that ooey gooey chocolatey goodness. The buffet is fantastic too. There are typical things like sweet and sour chicken and beef and broccoli to prime rib, crab legs, and sushi. During lunch it usually runs about $20/person which is a steal for everything you get. Love this place!",5.0

82,DtSq9MGfG5svRZYN6ipklA,wvjGYAnSoujqefr0YJ4_tA,ixyQUGEg7QhaW1UgGAmrfw,Citywide Alarms is the best alarm system company in St. Louis! The set up and install for my alarms was a painless process and I love knowing that my business is safe and secure with their help. What I loved most was that they treat you like family! I also really enjoy how easy it is to control my security system with the convenience of the alarm app. I recommend Citywide Alarms to anyone who wants the piece of mind of having their home or business safe and secure. Thanks guys!,5.0

Although you couldn't actually enter the rooms, you got a excellent view of each room from an apartment from this period looked like. Each room is staged in beautifully maintained antiquities from the period and there are descriptions of some of the items that may be harder to identify. The lady at the desk was very friendly and we enjoyed it very much. It could take you 15 min to walk through it all, but if you want to take your time, you could certainly do so. This museum is not crowded at all.",5.0
54,2X6a9Ph20Vn9NMLiAC20Bg,2jzUtEPlWqoVw57Z8dSHcw,pWT3WAUvww4iqF-v2htBXA,"I do not give 5 star reviews very often, and when I do you can be assured it is deserved. The prices are what you would expect for an Italian restaurant, and the atmosphere is very nice. You can feel comfortable bringing a date here or just pulling up to their bar for a nice bite and cocktail. I came during their happy hour and they have several items on special. I had the crispy Polenta with Bolognese sauce, Margherita flatbread, and sampled the meatball sliders.

First off the Bolognese sauce is stunning. I would have happily eaten a plate of anything with this sauce on it. I am not typically a Polenta fan but it was a shared appetizer and very tasty.

The flatbread was extremely tasty and probably the best Margherita pizza/flatbread I have eaten.

The meatball sliders were delicious and I wish I had room in my stomach to eat more of them.

I had an Italian margarita that was tasty and strong, along with a few beers. They have a full bar of course and can whip up pretty much anything you might want. The southern cucumber is also much tastier than cucumber based drinks I have tried at other places.

I will most certainly return and try more of their dishes, based on this trip there is no doubt I will love anything I eat here. Do yourself a favor and try this place, you will not be disappointed!",5.0

I had met with Amy and talked to her before bringing my dogs in for services. I got a really good feel from her. I can't explain exactly what it was, just something about her that put me at ease and made me feel comfortable bringing my maltipoo puppies in to get groomed by her. The Northern Liberties area has many options to choose from in terms of dog grooming, I have tried a few of the other places but now my girls only go to Amy. I am beyond happy with her services, when I get my girls back from a salon appointment they always look and smell great. Plus I love the little bows in the hair. I think she does a great job and best of all is very reasonably priced compared to the other options in the area.

The flavors are really creative and spot on. I've had macs in Paris at laduree and it may just be the American in me but I like these better for the taste, size and value. The cookies have the texture and flavor that makes macs delicious and unique and the fillings are decadent and tasty as they should be. The milk and honey was one of my favorites as many others have also said.",5.0

They were extremely helpful, courtesy, and knowledgeable. The design of the building is modern and fresh, and the facility itself is clean and well maintained. The rental fees are reasonable, they delivered on all fronts. I would highly recommend Sevier Park Community Center to anyone looking for a space to hold an event from a birthday party to a family reunion! 

FYI - They also offer numerous exercise classes, as well as workout equipment, in addition to a playground, paved walking paths, and outdoor basketball courts. I have not personally taken advantage of these aspects yet, but plan to in the near future.",5.0

They quoted me an approximate price and a short time later I was in the showroom.

While it is still fresh in my mind I want to describe my experience. First of all my surgeon was Dr. William Hozack a superb surgeon who did my husband's hip replacement 14 years ago. Dr. Hozack' commitment to my care was evident at every turn, from a reassuring pre-op visit from him and his entire handpicked team to a private room post op which was a blessing. When one is not feeling their best, privacy is a much valued commodity. I stand,in sheer awe, at the degree of professionalism, kindness and patience displayed by every member of the recovery room nursing staff. Thank you, Elise and Christa. Special thanks to my nurses, especially, Lance, Monica, and Bernadette who made my post op stay at Jefferson bearable. There is no question that nursing is a vocation when confronted with the level of care that I received during my stay at Jefferson hospital. Now 5 days postoperative and in rehab for awhile
I feel I have crossed the first threshold in what I expect to be an exciting and satisfying journey. Thank you for my new knees!",5.0

I ordered the Veggie Deluxe for take out. The roll was perfectly crusty and seeded. The eggplant, broccoli rabe, and peppers were seasoned and sauteed to perfection. The slices of sharp provelone added that extra bite that the sandwich needed. I could eat one of these a week and never get tired of it. The prices are high but well worth it! I usually get two meals out of one hoagie so that is how I justify spending over $10 for one of these delicious creations.",5.0

8,biOz1Mxp9k_ZwAM4uZ8Xgw,Rfmm3r2JvUqEVDpCdwBzvg,w9grvGu-5bHNucOeReHzfA,"Last night was my third time going to Urban Grub. I've been pleased every time, but last night was the first time I've been inclined to share my experience. I went there with my wife and our waiter was nice: helpful but not overbearing.

However, shortly before or after ordering our food, another man came around to the nearby tables and introduced himself in a manner suggesting he was the manager (he said his name but I have forgotten it). I asked if he was the owner and he said he was just the general manager/janitor (paraphrasing him), and even shook hands with me. He was very pleasant to talk to and after we talked about the food a bit he bragged about the tastiness of his wife's - the pasty chef's - vanilla bean donuts (how could I not make a mental note of that?).

We ordered the Lobster BLT Flatbread (which is basically lobster alfredo flatbread, very tasty) and the double-cut pork chop. This was the first time I've had the lobster BLT, but the third time I've had the pork chop. It is the best pork chop I've ever eaten, hands down. They have an excellent cooking method for it.

We also had the donuts for dessert of course, but they were somewhat too sweet for me and I think of myself as a sweet tooth! The ice cream it comes with was great though. I still ate it all; don't want to think about the calories. :-(

At the end the manager came around again and asked how the food was. We still had about 1/4 of the pork chop left to take home: we shared the flatbread and the entree and still couldn't eat it all, that's how big the cut is. He took our plate himself to put in a box. AFAIK, that's the only time I've ever seen a manager bus the table, and that's why I felt compelled to leave this review.",5.0

13,7QOiH5QL_GHTSJKF0m9hUg,XWF_QYq8BgpFvZ8tgpFCSw,95r3jAJRn10e9aB5I_NlPg,"Lunch date with my beautiful mom! Found off the beatin path going to the Botanical Gardens, and it was amazing! Slow considering it was a mid Monday lunch. Beautiful decor/atmosphere. Seat yourself at one of the edgy marble table tops with non matched yet all unique chairs. Appreciated the large windows throughout since there was not a cloud in the sky, but saw the cozy set up in the corner with an inviting custom antique fireplace, and actually can't wait for a snowy night to come back and enjoy a glass of wine when the time arrives. 

Food: speechless.. I'm a lover of French dips, and this hands down was the best I've ever had. Mind you cheese does not come with it, and I'm fine with that. It is an extra charge. The roast beef was sliced to perfection and layered just right. Au ju was the perfect temp and flavor. Sandwiches come with potato salad but can be substituted out for any salad of your choice, soup, and I believe other sides. I stopped listening when I heard sub a salad. I've forgotten the specific name of the salad, I believe it's the house. It was filled with fresh artichokes, onion hearts, mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette etc etc.. So perfect for lunch, and left me feeling refreshed. 

Beverages: After going to the gardens we decided to end the afternoon with a cocktail and returned to Sasha's. My mom ordered a simple vodka/club soda. I orders a Long Island ice tea. Once again I'm going to say that I'm a huge fan of long islands. Hands down the best I've had! The bartender brought out fresh lemons and squeezed fresh juice into it, he poured all the liquor precisely into the glass..., and then put his own mix into it that I feel ashamed if I share and really highly recommended going here as soon as possible. Prices for everything where by far underpriced or right on!",5.0

83,_qyhWvGhnqx254q5x4c4zQ,y-0AdZ3raOYQBPJRrxuwog,z8MZGKqg79ih1www6azXyA,"This was the first night of our vacation, and I picked this place based off of fellow Yelper reviews who did not lead me astray.  Everything that makes a restaurant a place you want to visit again and again from service, to food, to ambience was there.  We were running late due to construction, and I called the hostess who reassured me it was not a problem and was welcoming and reassuring.  When we arrived, I was impressed with the beautiful woods, warm light, and overwhelming smells of delicious foods from the kitchen. 

Walking to our table, we all kept saying, ""oh my gosh it smells good!""  Our waiter, Allasandra (Alex) was a total joy, knowledgable about the menu, and happy to share with us his recommendations.  We started with the Antipasto Meraviglia.  The cheeses were fabulous!  I heard the olives were also great--I didn't get one.  

From there we went to the arugula salad with a delicious lemon/olive oil dressing and fabulous parmesan cheese.  The next course is where the winners (which we all were) and the exceptional dishes blossomed.  The special was a lasagne made with meatballs. The red sauce was extraordinary.  The portion was huge, but my youngest never came up for breath before he was done.  My oldest had the Ravioli Villa Bellini, a delicious lobster ravioli with a light cream sauce.  I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate.  My husband had the Tortellini Dunedin, filled with veal and beef in a mushroom sauce.  Pretty off the hook.  But the star of the night was the Saccottini Ciro.  Maybe one of the top five most delicious entrees I've ever had. Everyone tried it--to the point of me wielding my knife to protect my dinner--and declared it spectacular.  It was summed up best by my youngest who said, ""It's like Jesus made this for us because he wants us to know he loves us.""   If you go here, you must have this. Don't experience a dinner anywhere near Tampa without driving here to have this. 

We ended with the chocolate soufflé and ice cream.  Very wonderful evening made even more special by our fabulous waiter, beautiful setting and unique food.  Go here!  You won't be sorry other than the button you move on your pants because it's all so good you cannot stop!",5.0

I walked in and made sure to ask if they were accepting the certificates on that particular night.  She welcomed us in and seated us near the patio.  It was a bit too hot for my taste to sit outside, but we were still able to enjoy a gorgeous view!

I ordered a wedge salad to start and they brought it out in record time along with a couple of different breads for us to sample.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgable.  She explained the breads and before we ordered we had a couple of questions about the 'burnt edges' brisket.  She was more than happy to answer our questions and was very informative.

My mother ordered the one meat plate with brisket and mac and cheese as her side.  I ordered the one meat plate with chicken and a side of fruit.

The chicken was properly cooked.  I've been so shocked lately at the amount of undercooked chicken I have received.  The smoky flavor was absolutely delicious.  The side of fruit was large and had a nice assortment.  I was very pleased!

My mother seemed to very much enjoy the brisket.  As someone else stated...a teeny bit dry, but it gets you to try those tasty sauces on the table!  The mac and cheese was a generous portion and boy was it cheesy!  Delicious.

I knew it was going to be really nice inside, but the décor and ambiance exceeded my expectations. We were the first table of the night and had the restaurant to ourselves for a little bit. We used a gift card purchased on Daily Candy, but it would've been worth it either way. 

Everything we ordered was very good. We went with the calamari as an appetizer. It was lightly fried and I really liked the sweet & spicy dressing served with it.. this gave it a nice kick. For dinner, we both ordered the filet and were really happy with what we got. Wild porcini crust for me and smoky ancho for him. For sides, we went with the mashed potatoes and smoky collard greens. Pretty standard but still good.",4.0
85,4W6uuwGYiDM2PlctrISiQw,x5_wSiB2y5lXCFp8WlGf1A,o1DuWXCV_kg_mSqNOxUdew,"So... from what I hear, and based on some quick Yelp-research, I realized that this up-and-coming Ijji restaurant is trying something new with Reno. They have their customers cooking their own meat - thus creating their own, unique experience - at a reasonably priced location in Northwest Reno.

Some foodies may not realize is that Korean style cuisine is a very simple, hearty, meat-&-veggie type style. There is little spice, including garlic, mustard, red pepper, etc.... and that my lead some to think that the food here is boring/not as good as their other popular resturants located throughout the area. Here, Ijji has turned the heat up on the overall experience in hope to draw in a crowd and make visits more of an experience. 

Experience:

So we arrived for a rather late lunch/early dinner. Something that I highly recommend if you want to to the AYCE style and you roll two meals into one....while rolling yourself out the door at the end of the night. We were seated quickly, however it seems like they only keep half of the restaurant available for lunch, while opening both sides for dinner. 

After we were seated I realized that Ijji has done a great job of ventilating the eating space with fans pulling in the smoke on the table, and numerous intakes/outs for AC. In fact, it was a little chilly in there so ladies.....bring that sweater. 

AYCE for lunch is only $19.99 - which is a pretty good deal for how much meat we ate. We were in protien heaven! One thing that occurred to me after we sat down was that the vegetables surrounding the pit were a little dry to the touch. They either sat at the table waiting for us too long or these side dishes are prepared too early in the kitchen and by the time they arrive to the table they just don't have that ""freshly prepared"" look to them, and are a little dry. (Hence my dropped star)

We decided to just go down the AYCE menu, ordering meats in order. The first few meats were beef, where I highly recommend the first beef option listed. They' re super fast to cook, and great to slap on while chowing down on other food. The next suggestion I have is the chef's chicken. It was very fresh, we happened to cook it perfectly (haha!), and we ended ordering it for a second time. PS: The spicy options aren't TOO spicy...great for people who are so spice intolerant like me!

Speaking of ordering, there was a lot of confusion for us about what was AYCE and what was a la carte only. In this case, we ended up asking the waiter to repeat it to us the first few times because it wasn't clear on the menu. However, I'm assuming they will fix this because it seemed to be really confusing to other guests too. Also, another thing missing from their menu....DESSERT?! I know it's lunch.... but with all the protein and veggies with salty sauces...I really wanted something sweet to end my meal.

Overall, we will be visiting Ijji 4 again for dinner or lunch again. Its just so conveniently placed to everywhere else we shop that this place will be hard to avoid.",4.0

12,MYnjr9DavXGljSC6UXvaWg,KfxFfpYT_0RD7Fa7RVI8Wg,ajUf1h6j8KZ9bg69MSKxSQ,"So many changes to this park that it is no longer a scary place to visit. Once upon a time, it was known as a drug haven with teens hanging out there doing God knows what.  Now, with the new playground there, it has become a much better place for families.  There are grills out there in which to barbecue.  The waterfront view has always been pretty, but now it is safe as well.  The playground is awesome.  So many fun things for the kids to run and jump on.  Love the addition of the water park area where the kids can dash through the sprinklers/fountain and get wet to cool off.  They even covered the playground area with a tent looking type thing, though they are spaced apart, so it doesn't really cover the playground well enough not to get wet when it rains.  There is plenty of places for the grown ups to sit and places to have a nice lunch in the gazebo type areas.  Would be nicer if the water area had some cute fountains instead of a ""hose"" type atmosphere...but the addition of the water area is still a nice touch and let's be honest, the kids could not care less about the fun looking fountains.  They just want to get wet.

There is also a separate area for younger little ones, so they don't get run over by the crazy 8 year olds in the area.  That's a nice touch.

The other cool thing here?  The adult fitness area.  The only time I have ever seen one of these was when I was in Venice Beach in California.  There is a stair stepper, a place to do pull ups, a rowing machine and it is all a very cool addition for this area.  Granted, it is too hot most days to utilize it, but in the mornings, it is probably cool enough to use it.  This is a much better set up than the old wood park that was starting to get really run down.  

The other thing I love about this park for the kids is the equipment they have there is much more spread out than at the wood park.  It's also contemporary and it is much easier to see where your children are than in the old wood park, where you couldn't see through the playground to the other side.  You had to follow your kids around everywhere just to keep an eye on them.

The only real gripe I have with this place, still, is the lack of parking in the area.  And maybe, I find the multiple exits out of the park a bit disarming.  The whole thing should be fenced all the way around to keep the little animals, er...children, within the perimeter of the park.  But, if you are an attentive parent or grandparent, you shouldn't have much trouble keeping the kids reined in.  

Overall, the park is a great addition to the New Port Richey area.  It's within walking distance to restaurants, cafes and the ice cream shop on the corner.  It's a very pleasant place to spend the day and as far as I am concerned, anything that gets your kids away from their electronics is a good thing!",4.0

I was expecting the price to be high, sonce dealerships have a reputation for overcharging, but actually the price was pretty competitive and I figured they use genuine Toyota parts here. They have free shuttles to take you to and from work, which I definitely needed because the timing belt takes all day. There is also free food (bagels, muffins, etc.) in the waiting area.

The work on my car ended up needing a second day, which made me upset, but luckily my associate Logan hooked me up with a rental car for free. It was still inconvenient, but it could have been really bad without that.

i was disappointed that 2 of the entrees were basically blocks of tofu, while other options were the expected mushrooms and seitan.

that said, my tofu (Pacific Rim Grilled Tofu -spicy gochujang glaze, edamame potato purée, japanese eggplant and pea leaf salad, smoked miso broth) was wonderfully grilled w/ a great smoky flavor. the edamame mash that it rested upon was delightful even if the broth was a bit salty.

the other stand out was the Yucatan Chopped Salad (shredded romaine & baby spinach, poblano, cilantro, corn, avocado and chayote, smoked black olives, guajillo lime vinaigrette)

we also tried their version of a Margarita, which tho it had jalapeno could've had a bit more bite.

Unfortunately, they closed the one near my parents' house, so we thought it might be a fun adventure to go into Center City and visit the one downtown. I love this location because it's right on the corner in the shadow of City Hall.

I have to say that the first impression here was not so great. I called ahead to make a reservation just in case. The gentleman who helped me talked to me while some kind of awful very unprofessional music was playing in the background. Then he put me on hold forever. Then he came back and the music was gone, so I don't know if he moved to a different phone. And then he seemed to have a lot of trouble actually taking my reservation. It should not have been that hard.

At any rate, we show up for said reservation and from there things did improve. Our waitress was very good. I ordered the clam chowder for the first time ever and was delighted to find that it is partly based on a very generous helping of bacon that makes it warm and decadent and a pretty darn good cup of soup. For lunch I had the crispy fish tacos, which were pretty good except for the incredible amount of raw onion. Since the whole taco is covered in sauce, it's tough to pick out pieces of excess onion. But other than that, the dish was decent. Others got shrimp scampi, which got good reviews, and a burger (a non-seafood lover in our group).

Others have said it, but it's not a cheap meal. Still it was OK for a treat. There is valet parking during dinner hours but not lunch. Parking in any of the nearly downtown parking decks will run you $10-$16 or so on a normal day. Just something to know if you are planning to park.",3.0

I get it sometime places run out of things. then they brought out my burger and my husbands was going to be ""right out"" once I was halfway done with my burger the server brought out my husbands fries and no burger. I was shocked. then when I was done with my meal and another couple minutes goes by and the server brought out the burger. by this time my husband's fries were cold. the server didnt appear phased and by this time we had to leave because we had our young child with us but to say th eleast it was not the way we wanted to spend a special occasion.

The chicken tortilla soup is okay but the turkey chili is quite good - nicely seasoned and full of meat.

I was disappointed in my under cooked calzone and my friend was disappointed in the dry sandwich. Although it came with au jus he was hoping for a little bit of flavor from the meat, that was really just lackluster.

I think most of us have eaten there and it's a fun place for a date or special occasion.  However, my dining experiences over the last few years have left a lot to be desired and last night was the icing on the cake.  
Once again, they have raised their priced and reduced the amount of food you receive.  I was with friends and we each picked a different ""individual entree"" since the hostess told us that was the best way to get more food for less money.  Bullshit.  
We started with the cheese of course.  We weren't brought bread for dipping until we were halfway through our cheese. When the entrees arrived I nearly fell out of the booth.  There were 2 pieces of each protein on the plate. The portion size of each cut was measly.  Now let's talk about the quality of the meat and seafood.  Garbage.  I'm convinced they're getting their groceries from the Super WalMart up the road.  Considering each individual entree was between $30-$35, I was outraged. They can counter and say well the cheese fondue was included for the table, but it was just that cheese and for the table.  
Let's talk about the Manager who came to our table, Chris.  He seemed very nice initially.  However, after he asked if everything went well, my friend in good humor told him she was disappointed that she was unable to use both of her gift cards for the bill.  They limit you to 1 per table.  After some good natured banter, he told us that if we would like 36% gratuity added to the bill that he would be willing to do it.  So we said sure (they add 18% for the use of 1 gift card).  We had no problem with our server reaping the benefit.  He was a nice. kid.  Chris left the table with the additional gift card and came back a few minutes later, handing the card to my friend.  We looked puzzled. Yeah, Chris was a tool.  He didn't allow us to use the 2nd card.  I don't appreciate the 10 minutes of my time that was wasted with his act.",2.0

I was willing to overlook that it was right next to a cheap hotel/motel on strip-club mile. I was willing to overlook the cat sitting at the front door (it even made its way in part way through my time there, meowing at everyone). I was skeptical with only two other tables in the place occupied when I came in and it was still loud as fuck.

Our waitress wasn't pleasant, even from the beginning. She had two tables to wait on, it's not like they were so swamped she didn't have time for niceties. It was a pain in the ass having to constantly flag her down for drinks/refills, ordering an extra menu item, etc. and getting such an attitude. When we were given a Thai tea instead of an iced coffee she wasn't thrilled about having to correct it.

As for the food, I ordered the Tom Kha Gai and the beef salad, both of them  medium spicy. The salad was way spicier than the soup, but maybe it's because the coconut broth kills some of the heat. The soup was unremarkable. The broth separated before it even was put in front of me and wasn't too creamy. It was mainly sour and there wasn't very much chicken in it. I wouldn't order it again. The only thing I could taste in the salad was red pepper.

I'm writing this as a plea to please get the potatoes right. They have never been completely cooked, tastes like they were cooked in overly salted water, underseasoned and always cold. I had the veggie scrambler and the onion, pepper and mushroom appeared not to be cooked with the typical potatoes and as usual not hot. It's starting to tastes like ingredients are being switched out for lesser quality such as with the pancakes.
So why would I order potatoes again? It's because I just want to believe  they will get it right. There are many good menue items but this is a menu staple and it's ruinning the experience. Please put some love in your potatoes and make it memorable. After all there is a lot of competition out there.",2.0

The brisket was OK but both Fette Sau and Sweet Lucy's are much better.  The sausage was unremarkable.  The BBQ ribs were the best items on the plate being flavorful and tender.

- Meals came out at different times. Two people received their food at least five minutes before me and when mine arrived it was cold.
- Waiter stood there and watched me fill in the tip and sign the check.
- Food is extremely expensive. $70 for 4 people.

Then I went online to look at reviews.  This happened in the wrong order, I know. Oooops.  Oh well.   What I found was that this place had tons of bad Yelp reviews - eeek!!  BUT, also they changed their name to fool people I think, on Yelp it's listed as La Bella Vita, but they have since changed it to La Vita Bella.  Close, but different.

After a few phone calls I was able to make the appointment.  I mentioned to the woman on the phone that I had buyer's remorse now, based on what I was reading on the internet.  She assured me that none of what I read would happen - new management, new attitude. 

Feeling paranoid, I called to confirm my appointment the day prior to my massage, since they never called me.  An unprofessional start when I had to call them.  

The day of my appointment, I arrived 10 minutes early, prior to my massage, like a good client.  I was greeted in the lobby by 2 women sitting behind a desk furiously and continuously addressing envelopes. I was given water to drink, filled out my paperwork and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  My appointment was at 4:00PM. I got there at 3:50PM.   I paid $69 for what was supposed to be a 60 minute Swedish massage, a foot scrub, and a hand treatment.  

After waiting in the lobby for FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES I was finally shown back to the massage room.   My massage started 45 minutes after it was scheduled.  Because I sat there the whole time in the lobby staring at the clock in anger, I know precisely what time the therapist took me back - 4:45PM.

I get my massage, which was pretty good (the foot scrub lasted exactly 2 minutes total) she told me to get dressed, I looked at my phone for the time - yep, it was 5:25PM.  If you're good at math, like I am, you would be able to see that it was only a 40 minute massage.

I alerted the therapist to her miscalculation and she proceeded to claim that it was an hour and that she set her phone timer.   Now the 2 women at the reception desk were gone and it was just her and I.  She obviously tried to get away with ripping me off and when I caught her, she had nothing to say other than to make lame excuses.  She even then said that I shouldn't have been waiting in the waiting room for an hour, because the receptionist told her that they called everyone to tell them they were running late.  I showed her my call log and asked her to point out the call that she was referring to.  Of course that was also a lie. 

What a rip off this place is.  Entirely unprofessional and for the $69 Groupon ""deal"" for a 40 minute massage after waiting nearly an hour, a total disappointment.

We ordered a filet mignon, a NY strip, potatoes au gratin and the Brussels sprouts.  I do not suggest the Brussels sprouts to anyone, as I typically love them but The Palm's were unbelievably bland.  The prices of the sides are also not worth the portions you are given.  It took our waitress an extra 30 minutes to even come by and finally give us our check.

Quick tip - any person, place, or thing that labels itself ""gourmet"" (with the sole exception of the now-defunct Gourmet Magazine, RIP) is guaranteed to let you down in matters of culinary taste.  I don't like to generalize, but this is one generalization you can take to the bank, along with the one that ""luxury condos"" are never luxurious.   

The ""gourmet"" pizzas at Peace a Pizza are of a type - the type that thinks you need to pile endless tons of ""inventive"" crap on top of overly thick crust for a satisfying and ""gourmet"" bite.  When will these types of pizzerie learn that the best pizzas are the ones that take care to produce a chewy crust - not thick, but well-stretched, flavorful, and chewy - and feature a few carefully chosen toppings, rather than an avalanche of entrees?   Novelty is overrated.  Macaroni and cheese on pizza is wrong.   Ranch dressing on pizza is wrong.  Alfredo sauce on pizza is disgusting.  If you want to eat a cheesesteak, eat a cheesesteak, not a cheesesteak pizza.  

There's something to be said for learning to do it right, rather than trying to be ""original"" and provide ""variety.""  I'd rather have a plain cheese slice from any pizza by the slice place in Philly any day, or every day for the rest of my life, than another slice from Peace A Pizza.",1.0

When you first walk in the atmosphere is relaxing and there is a nice little pond with coy fish in it. I decided to sit in a booth instead of at the sushi bar or hibachi tables. Soon after being seated I noticed that some paint was chipping off of the walls next to me. There was also a dirty vase on the table with a dusty and broken plastic flower in it for decoration. 

For my beverage I ordered the hot tea. It was your average tasting Oolong. 

I ordered the steak entree, some edamame, and a cherry blossom sushi roll for my meal. The Edamame was very good. Not too much salt, just the right amount. Next was the salad which had a good ginger dressing but was on top of what seemed like an iceberg lettuce and carrot mix that you would find in a bag at the grocery store.

 After that, was the onion soup. I always look forward to this the most because it is a comfort food of mine. Sadly it tasted like fried chicken juice and not really like onion at all. The onions that were in it were oddly mushy. I was not impressed. 

When the entree arrived I was hopeful that it would be good because it looked fresh. The portion was a bit too big but that seems to be the case at most hibachi restaurants. My steak was good, maybe a bit under seasoned but I would rather it be that than the alternative. Unfortunately the rice was overcooked and way too mushy. 

The cherry blossom roll was supposed to have crab in it and tuna on top but it seemed to have ground up tuna in it instead of crab. The sushi rice was also overcooked and the tuna tasted old and I didn't eat the rest for fear of getting sick. All in all it was not a good experience and I will not be returning.",1.0

Everything was cool until another group of people came in and the waitress sat them down... Right next to us, like less than a foot away. The entire room was empty but these people were on top of us.

Typically, I would say something but they were so close that I didn't want to ask to move and make the other customers think it had something to do with them. It was awkward to say the least. 

At that point, having a conversation was weird because I could almost hear our neighbors breathing . 

I've spent time in NYC restaurants and it's common to invade personal space when space is limited in tiny NY delis... Newsflash: were in Florida, space isn't an issue. 

The staff seemed more concerned with their closing routine then customer service. I've experienced this there before but it didnt matter because the food was great, the food wasn't great tonight. The fries tasted like they had been sitting all night.

Me and my girlfriend went there to see Connor Oberst, last night, October 21. The tickets were for open seating and the layout was solid chairs with two aisles running down the middle and a small opening in front for standing room. The place was overpacked when the show started, beyond a safe, fire code level of packed. So we looked up and saw that there was an empty balcony with 100 open seats and decided to head up there and enjoy the show in relative peace. However, we were informed the balcony was closed and had to be herded back into the crowd.

This wouldn't have merited me needed to go out of my way to review this place had it not been for what happened next. We were standing in a peaceful, but overpacked crowd when the show started and of course, due to overcrowding people were spilling into the aisle. So a very rude and loud security guard started screaming for people to get out of the aisle while flashing their flashlight in peoples faces. This was while Connor was playing his set. There was no alternative given on where people could go, so the guard was literally forcing people to smoosh into each other. This continued through three songs and that we could not enjoy due to the yelling until people go squeezed so tight and jostled so roughly an older man behind us got shoved into me and my girlfriend causing his wine to spill all over her hair and covering both the backs of our shirts. Mind you, everyone was doing their best to calmly comply, there simply was not enough room.

So after three songs we weren't able to enjoy, we left covered with wine stains, and out $72 for the most overpriced horrible experience of both our lives. As we were leaving there was a group of women pleading with security to let them into the balcony because there was no space for people who paid $36 to actually go in and see the show. 

I hope other people share their experience from this night because I will never return to this venue and feel robbed of our money and our ability to see a performer we loved.",1.0
